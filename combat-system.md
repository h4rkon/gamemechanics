## Introduction
In the times of the Roman Empire, war was common, and often large armies fought against each other. With this combat system being as realistic as possible, a playable battle simulation can be achieved. The basic idea is to move units of each army with orders given by central intelligence (a General) from a remote focal point. Units move towards each other and try to follow the order of the General. In case of contact (or reach), units automatically attack reachable enemy units until new orders arrive.

## Unit types

Three distinct unit types engage in battles: Infantry, Archers, and Cavalry. Each unit has situational strengths and weaknesses when facing others. Unlike a simple rock-paper-scissors system, where one unit always dominates another, the combat system offers a more conditional and realistic experience. This design adds complexity to gameplay but rewards players who employ deeper strategic thinking and leadership.

As an example, while archers are generally an effective unit, the number of inflicted casualties depends on their ability to hit a vulnerable target. Infantry, for instance, is typically well-protected with shields and armor, which reduces the impact of arrows. On the other hand, archers themselves are lightly armored, making them highly vulnerable to enemy archers. Additionally, while archers may be more effective against cavalry than infantry due to the cavalry's lighter protection, their advantage is short-lived. Cavalry can quickly close the distance and overwhelm the archers, stripping them of their effectiveness once engaged in close combat.
